## Overview

As my academical background is Art History, I decided to merge my interest for design and art and create branding and a landing page for Michelangelo.
You can find the finalised project on Behance along with a brief description below in the links section.

## My Process

I started with creating the branding by using an illustration of the David statue that I have done previously. I played around with the typographies and created also two logos and a pattern.

When I had the branding complete I did some wireframes and hi-fi mock ups on Adobe XD, which I then translated into a landing page.
